# Azure Search for Umbraco

ExamineX is a product to effortlessly integrate [Azure Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/search/) or [Elastic Search](https://examinex.online/2024/02/15/elastic-search-support) with [Umbraco](https://umbraco.com) all while using the same Examine APIs you know and love.

Tired of Lucene file locks? Startup delays when scaling out? Indexes out of sync? Downtime from index rebuilding? ... All of this is solved with ExamineX.

* Very easy to setup
* Ideal when hosting Umbraco on [Azure Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/app-service/web/)
* Perfect solution for load balancing and auto-scaling
* Works on [Umbraco Cloud](https://umbraco.com/products/umbraco-cloud/)
* APIs provided for working directly with Azure Search services

ExamineX swaps the default indexing and search engine from [Lucene.Net](https://lucenenet.apache.org/) to a hosted/managed solution on Azure Search. 

Since ExamineX is an implementation of [Examine](https://shazwazza.github.io/Examine/), you don't need to make any code changes and you can continue to use all of the existing Examine and Umbraco APIs that you are already used to.

ExamineX is developed by the creator of [Examine](https://shazwazza.github.io/Examine/).
